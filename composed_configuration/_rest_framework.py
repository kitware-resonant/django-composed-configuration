            # It's important that true SPAs and other clients be forced to go though
            # OAuth2Authentication instead, as this is the only supported auth mechanism which
            # robustly works across origins; however, it turns out that this can only be enforced
            # partially.
            # To understand why, first read https://web.dev/same-site-same-origin/ to understand
            # that even with "SameSite=Lax" (or "SameSite=Strict"), cookies are only technically
            # limited to same-site requests, and do not have the stronger same-origin limitation.
            # If a naive SPA developer configures their client to include credentials
            # ("{withCredentials: true}" in XHR, jQuery, and Axios, or "{credentials: 'include'}"
            # in Fetch; this configuration is often suggested as an "easy" fix for authentication
            # problems by StackOverflow), then the session cookie will be sent with any cross-site
            # requests where the user has logged into the Django server. Note, cross-site requests
            # include origins with a different port (typical in local development) and origins with
            # a different subdomain (common in many deployments). From DRF's perspective, as long
            # as the request uses a safe verb (more on this below), the request will be
            # authenticated transparently. However, since Django is configured to not set
            # "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", the SPA client will not be able to read the
            # response and get a CORS error; this is the right outcome (client cannot effectively
            # make the request), but with a confusing and hard-to-debug reason (CORS error,
            # instead of a 401/403) and developers may be tempted to "fix" it by enabling
            # "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" instead of fixing their client to use OAuth
            # correctly, which will likely lead to further bugs when the SPA is deployed to a
            # non-same-site environment. Alternatively, if the request does not use a safe verb
            # (and the request is not preflighted by the browser, which is permitted in some
            # cases), DRF will enforce CSRF protection and the request will 403 fail with a
            # "CSRF Failed: CSRF token missing or incorrect" message, which is also confusing and
            # may lead developers to incorrect fixes.
